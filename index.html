              <div class="column">Since 1950 global mean temperatures have followed a consistent upwards trend. In some countries the temperature differential has reached two degrees higher. While throughout the history of our planet the climate has changed significantly, never before has it been at the rate we are experiencing currently.</div>
              <div class="column">The vast majority of climate scientists concur that the unprecendented rate in which global temperatures are increasing is linked to human behaviour. More specifically, this can be attributed to CO2 production. Unfortunately the change in our climate has had far reaching consequences for our planet, the likes of which we will explore below.</div>

              <div>As climate change worsens so too does the frequency and severity of natural disasters. World wide we can see that the number of natural disasters per year has more than doubled since 1980. We can see that flooding has increased the most in comparison to other disasters. This is unsurprising when we consider how much average ocean levels have increased in previous decades.</div>
              <div>While wildfires globally have not increased as much as other disasters, here in Australia we have had a different story. Over the past 10 years we have had many black summers, many lives lives and homes lost. Along the east coast we can expect this trend to continue in the years to come. Inhabitants of NSW in particular will have to seriously consider the risk they will face in their current location.</div>

                  The 33% predicted extinction figure can be attributed to: Loss of habitat, reduction in food availability and natural disasters. Biodiversity is extremely important to ecosystems and as such significant species loss has a snowballing effect.

Floods, fires, cyclones, climate change is undeniably a huge threat to humanity. The second graph which is normalised for population demonstrates that not only is climate change it also disproportionately effects the global south. </div>
              <div>While the absolute number of climate related deaths in Bhutan is relatively low in comparison to other countries, its loss of life relative to its population is 3x higher than the next worse off country. While the west continues to dominant in the production of green house gases, the brunt of the consequences from this reckless behaviour is borne by non western countries.</div>
